        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. 
            This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience. <br/><br/>
            Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, 
            we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.
            The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. 
            Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 
            and in video games such as Super Mario.<br/><br/>
            With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it today
            Here are ten outstanding parallax scrolling examples built with Wix, handpicked for your web design inspiration
            Nolan Omura is a Hawaii-based photographer and videographer specializing in underwater photography. His ingenious take on the parallax scrolling effect adds depth and motion to his already captivating homepage design.
            By dividing the page into full-width strips, site visitors are met with exhilarating shots of aquatic life each time they scroll down further. The strips float gently above one another, using a mix of both parallax and reveal scrolling effects.  
            Giving the photographs even more movement are minute animations. While these are barely discernible, the website animations - combined with the use of parallax and video - make this page fully come to life.</p>
